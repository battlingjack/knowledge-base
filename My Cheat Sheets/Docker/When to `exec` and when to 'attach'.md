Two ways to connect to the Docker container. I can either useÂ `attach`Â orÂ `exec`. It is important to know the difference.

- `attach`Â allows you to connect and interact with a containerâ€™s main process which hasÂ `PID 1`
- `exec`Â allows you to create a new process in the container

This significant difference in the way these both commands run loads to some useful and, oftentimes, problematic side-effects. You can essentially use theÂ `attach`Â command as a terminal share system. If you are connected to the same Docker container from two different screens or terminal sessions, you can run commands on either one of the terminals and the output will be streamed in real-time to all other connected screens/terminal sessions. Think of this as a poor manâ€™s pair programming setup ðŸ˜…

> PSA: donâ€™t actually use this for pair-programming

If you kill the main process the container will terminate.

Whereas, when you useÂ `exec`Â a new process is started on the Docker container. This is the command you are supposed to use almost always unless you know what you are doing with theÂ `attach`Â command. I just usually use theÂ `exec`Â command to launchÂ `bash`Â within the container and work with that. I use theÂ `attach`Â command primarily when I quickly want to see the output of the main process (`PID 1`) directly and/or want to kill it.
