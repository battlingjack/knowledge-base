## What is docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, deploying, and running applications using containers. Containers are a lightweight and portable way to package and run code, making it easier to move applications between different environments. Docker provides tools to build, ship, and run containers, as well as a registry for storing and sharing container images. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across different environments.

It is also an open source container runtime, supports mac, windows, linux.  

DOCKERFILE file format is used for building container images.
