1. **SCP (Secure Copy):**
```bash
scp -r /path/to/local/folder username@remote_host:/path/to/destination/folder
```

2. To set environment variables in a shell script, you can use the `export` command followed by the variable name and its value. Here's an example:
```bash
export MY_VAR="Hello, World" 
export ANOTHER_VAR="12345"
```
