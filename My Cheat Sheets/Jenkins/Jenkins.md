### 1. Why script?
    In Jenkins Pipeline DSL (Domain-Specific Language), the `script` block is used to define a Groovy script block where you can write arbitrary Groovy code. The `script` block allows you to execute any Groovy code within the context of a Jenkins Pipeline.

The primary reason for using the `script` block is to provide flexibility and extensibility in Jenkins Pipelines. While Jenkins Pipelines have built-in steps and DSL for various tasks, there may be scenarios where you need to perform custom operations or interact with tools and services in a way that's not covered by the built-in DSL. In such cases, you can use the `script` block to write Groovy code that can execute arbitrary logic.

In the context of Docker operations, using the `docker.withRegistry` step within a `script` block allows you to define custom logic for interacting with Docker registries, building Docker images, and pushing them to registries. This is necessary because Docker-related operations often require more complex logic and flexibility, and using a `script` block allows you to encapsulate that logic.

Here's an example of when you might use a `script` block in a Jenkins Pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Custom Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Custom logic here, such as running shell commands
                    sh 'echo "Custom build step"'
                    sh 'npm install'
                    // More custom logic...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `script` block is used to run custom shell commands as part of the Jenkins Pipeline, which may not be covered by the standard Jenkins DSL steps.

So, the use of the `script` block provides the flexibility to incorporate custom logic and operations into your Jenkins Pipelines when needed.
