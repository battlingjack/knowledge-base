## Pausing and Resuming a rollout of a Deployment

When you update a Deployment, or plan to, you can pause rollouts for that Deployment before you trigger one or more updates. When you're ready to apply those changes, you resume rollouts for the Deployment. This approach allows you to apply multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts.

- For example, with a Deployment that was created:
    
    Get the Deployment details:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl get deploy
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx     3         3         3            3           1m
    ```
    
    Get the rollout status:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl get rs
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         1m
    ```
    
- Pause by running the following command:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused
    ```
    
- Then update the image of the Deployment:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
    ```
    
- Notice that no new rollout started:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    deployments "nginx"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1   <none>
    ```
    
- Get the rollout status to verify that the existing ReplicaSet has not changed:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl get rs
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         2m
    ```
    
- You can make as many updates as you wish, for example, update the resources that will be used:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl set resources deployment/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updated
    ```
    
    The initial state of the Deployment prior to pausing its rollout will continue its function, but new updates to the Deployment will not have any effect as long as the Deployment rollout is paused.
    
- Eventually, resume the Deployment rollout and observe a new ReplicaSet coming up with all the new updates:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed
    ```
    
- Watch the status of the rollout until it's done.
    
    ```shell
    kubectl get rs -w
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   2         2         2         2m
    nginx-3926361531   2         2         0         6s
    nginx-3926361531   2         2         1         18s
    nginx-2142116321   1         2         2         2m
    nginx-2142116321   1         2         2         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         2         1         18s
    nginx-3926361531   3         2         1         18s
    nginx-2142116321   1         1         1         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         1         18s
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         2         19s
    nginx-2142116321   0         1         1         2m
    nginx-2142116321   0         1         1         2m
    nginx-2142116321   0         0         0         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         3         20s
    ```
    
- Get the status of the latest rollout:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl get rs
    ```
    
    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   0         0         0         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         3         28s
    ```
    

**Note:**Â You cannot rollback a paused Deployment until you resume it.
