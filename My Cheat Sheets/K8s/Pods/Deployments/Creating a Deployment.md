Before you begin, make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running. Follow the steps given below to create the above Deployment:

1. Create the Deployment by running the following command:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
    ```
    
2. Run `kubectl get deployments` to check if the Deployment was created.


    If the Deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:
    
    ```
    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s
    ```
    
    When you inspect the Deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed:
    
    - `NAME` lists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.
    - `READY` displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.
    - `UP-TO-DATE` displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
    - `AVAILABLE` displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
    - `AGE` displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
    
    Notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to `.spec.replicas` field.
    
3. To see the Deployment rollout status, run `kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment`.
    
    The output is similar to:
    
    ```
    Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
    ```
    
4. Run the `kubectl get deployments` again a few seconds later. The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s
    ```
    
    Notice that the Deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest Pod template) and available.
    
5. To see the ReplicaSet (`rs`) created by the Deployment, run `kubectl get rs`. The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
    nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s
    ```
    
    ReplicaSet output shows the following fields:
    
    - `NAME` lists the names of the ReplicaSets in the namespace.
    - `DESIRED` displays the desired number of _replicas_ of the application, which you define when you create the Deployment. This is the _desired state_.
    - `CURRENT` displays how many replicas are currently running.
    - `READY` displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
    - `AGE` displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
    
    Notice that the name of the ReplicaSet is always formatted as `[DEPLOYMENT-NAME]-[HASH]`. This name will become the basis for the Pods which are created.
    
    The `HASH` string is the same as the `pod-template-hash` label on the ReplicaSet.
    
6. To see the labels automatically generated for each Pod, run `kubectl get pods --show-labels`. The output is similar to:
    
    ```
    NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
    nginx-deployment-75675f5897-7ci7o   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=75675f5897
    nginx-deployment-75675f5897-kzszj   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=75675f5897
    nginx-deployment-75675f5897-qqcnn   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=75675f5897
    ```
    
    The created ReplicaSet ensures that there are three `nginx` Pods.
    
**Note:**
You must specify an appropriate selector and Pod template labels in a Deployment (in this case, `app: nginx`).

Do not overlap labels or selectors with other controllers (including other Deployments and StatefulSets). Kubernetes doesn't stop you from overlapping, and if multiple controllers have overlapping selectors those controllers might conflict and behave unexpectedly.

### Pod-template-hash label[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#pod-template-hash-label)

**Caution:** Do not change this label.

The `pod-template-hash` label is added by the Deployment controller to every ReplicaSet that a Deployment creates or adopts.

This label ensures that child ReplicaSets of a Deployment do not overlap. It is generated by hashing the `PodTemplate` of the ReplicaSet and using the resulting hash as the label value that is added to the ReplicaSet selector, Pod template labels, and in any existing Pods that the ReplicaSet might have.
