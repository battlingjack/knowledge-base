The command `echo $??` is used to display the exit status of the previously executed command in a Unix-like shell environment. 

In Unix-based systems, when a command is executed, it returns an exit status code to indicate whether it ran successfully or encountered an error. The exit status code `0` typically indicates success, while non-zero codes indicate various types of errors.

The `$?` is a special shell variable that holds the exit status of the last command executed.

So, when you run `echo $??`, it attempts to display the exit status of the previous command, which is represented by `$?`. However, the double question marks (`??`) in this command are not valid syntax and may result in an error or unexpected output.

If you want to check the exit status of the previous command, you can simply use `echo $?` without the additional question marks.
