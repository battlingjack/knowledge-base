1. Here are a few steps you can try to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that your internet connection is working properly. You can try pinging a known IP address to test connectivity. For example:
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```
If this succeeds, it indicates that your network connection is working and the issue is likely related to DNS.
    
2. **Check DNS Configuration**: Verify that your DNS server settings are correct. You can check the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` file to see which DNS servers are being used. Make sure they are valid and reachable.
    
3. **Check DNS Server Reachability**: Try to ping the DNS server(s) listed in `/etc/resolv.conf` to see if they are reachable. For example:
```bash
ping DNS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```
4. **Restart DNS Service**: If you suspect that the DNS service is not working correctly, you can try restarting it. The command to restart the DNS service may vary depending on your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```
5. **Check Firewall Settings**: Ensure that your firewall settings are not blocking DNS traffic. You may need to allow DNS traffic (UDP port 53) through your firewall.
    
6. **Use a Different DNS Server**: Temporarily switch to a different DNS server to see if the issue is resolved. You can use public DNS servers like Google's (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare's (1.1.1.1) for testing purposes.
    

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, there may be a more complex networking problem that requires further investigation.
