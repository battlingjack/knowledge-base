If you donâ€™t have the option to disable IPv6 directly in netplan or if your network configuration is managed differently, you can try these alternative methods to disable IPv6 on your system:

### 1. Disable IPv6 via `sysctl`

1. Edit the `sysctl.conf` file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
2. Add the following lines to disable IPv6 for all network interfaces:
```bash
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1 
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
```
    
3. Apply the changes:
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```
