Now that you have the storage directory set up on Proxmox, you can use it as a shared storage location for your VMs and LXC containers. Here's how to proceed:

---

## 1. **Set Up Your VMs and Containers to Use the New Storage**

Since you plan to run an **Arr stack** and have specific containers for **Home Assistant (HA OS)** and a **Docker host VM**, you'll want to configure these resources to use the new storage directory.

### Step-by-Step VM & LXC Setup Using the Storage Directory

1. **Create a New VM or LXC Container on Proxmox:**
   - In the Proxmox GUI, navigate to **Datacenter > Node (e.g., orangepi5) > Create VM** or **Create CT**.
   - Go through the setup wizard as usual, but on the **Storage** selection page, select `nvme_storage` (your newly created storage).

2. **Configure the VM/Container Storage:**
   - On the **Disk** page, you can adjust the size of the disk and assign it to the `nvme_storage` you created. This ensures that VM/container files are stored in the new NVMe partition.

## 2. **Automate Data Downloads with the Arr Stack on Docker**

To automatically download movies and media with the Arr stack, you can set up the required applications (such as Sonarr, Radarr, and Plex) on the **Docker host VM**.

### Setting Up Arr Stack in Docker

1. **Install Docker on the VM:**
   - SSH into the VM you’ve assigned as the Docker host.
   - Install Docker using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y docker.io
     sudo systemctl enable docker --now
     ```

2. **Create Docker Compose File for Arr Stack:**
   - In your Docker host VM, create a directory to store Docker configurations:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /mnt/nvme_storage/docker-arr
     cd /mnt/nvme_storage/docker-arr
     ```
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define Sonarr, Radarr, and Plex containers:
     ```yaml
     version: '3'
     services:
       sonarr:
         image: linuxserver/sonarr
         container_name: sonarr
         environment:
           - PUID=1000
           - PGID=1000
           - TZ=Asia/Kolkata
         volumes:
           - /mnt/nvme_storage/arr/sonarr:/config
           - /mnt/nvme_storage/media:/media
         ports:
           - 8989:8989
         restart: unless-stopped

       radarr:
         image: linuxserver/radarr
         container_name: radarr
         environment:
           - PUID=1000
           - PGID=1000
           - TZ=Asia/Kolkata
         volumes:
           - /mnt/nvme_storage/arr/radarr:/config
           - /mnt/nvme_storage/media:/media
         ports:
           - 7878:7878
         restart: unless-stopped

       plex:
         image: linuxserver/plex
         container_name: plex
         environment:
           - PUID=1000
           - PGID=1000
           - TZ=Asia/Kolkata
         volumes:
           - /mnt/nvme_storage/arr/plex:/config
           - /mnt/nvme_storage/media:/media
         ports:
           - 32400:32400
         restart: unless-stopped
     ```

3. **Deploy the Arr Stack:**
   - Run the following command in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

4. **Access Services:**
   - You should be able to access:
     - **Sonarr** at `http://<Docker-VM-IP>:8989`
     - **Radarr** at `http://<Docker-VM-IP>:7878`
     - **Plex** at `http://<Docker-VM-IP>:32400`

## 3. **Setting Up the Home Assistant OS in an LXC Container**

1. **Create an LXC Container for Home Assistant OS:**
   - In Proxmox, create a new LXC container and use `nvme_storage` for storage.
   - You can install **Home Assistant OS** in this container by following Home Assistant’s official guide.

2. **Mount Shared Media Storage in LXC Containers:**
   - You can mount `/mnt/nvme_storage/media` in the Home Assistant container to allow it to access downloaded media files.
   - Add this mount in the LXC configuration file (e.g., `/etc/pve/lxc/CTID.conf`):
     ```plaintext
     mp0: /mnt/nvme_storage/media,mp=/media
     ```

## 4. **Backup Configuration**

1. **Automated Backups to NFS or External Storage**:
   - To back up your entire Proxmox setup, including VMs and containers, schedule regular backups in **Datacenter > Backup** and store them in a separate directory or NFS share.
  
This architecture should give you a clean, organized, and accessible setup with separate VMs and containers for each service, all with centralized data on your NVMe storage. Let me know if you want more details on any part of the process!
